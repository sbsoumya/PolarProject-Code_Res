The FER is lower bounded by P_MD
We can do better with changing lambda as per expectation plot  by increasing lambda and thus reducing Theta if we are OK with making P_False alarm higher. We get lower P_MD (average of all P_MD for true channels) but we take a rate hit.
All the thresholdings are done at capacity.
At capacity the FER is almost 1, so the lower bound of ~0.05 is trivial 

By using lower rate and different thresholds we can get better results.
At this rate the FER is lower we need to check what lower bound is offered by P_MD by this.
This happens perhaps because at lower rates the number of bad channels increase (in particular more channels are included from the top).
